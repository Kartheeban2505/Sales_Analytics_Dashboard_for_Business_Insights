Gather and clean raw sales data (handle missing values, outliers, and data types).
Data Analysis
2. Calculate total revenue, total sales quantity, and analyze revenue and sales by market and product.
Revenue Trends and Key Insights
3. Analyze and visualize revenue trends over time, and identify top 5 customers and top 5 products.
Dashboard Design and Development
4. Create an interactive dashboard with visualizations for revenue, sales, market insights, and slicers for filtering by year and market.
Documentation and Finalization
5. Document the project in a README file, provide key insights, test the dashboard, and deploy it online (optional).
